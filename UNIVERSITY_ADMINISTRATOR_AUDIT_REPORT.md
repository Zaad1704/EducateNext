## üîö **CONCLUSION**

The EducateNext application has significant potential but requires substantial development work to meet university standards. The current security vulnerabilities and compliance gaps make it unsuitable for production deployment.

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Security must be the top priority** - critical vulnerabilities need immediate attention
- **Compliance cannot be an afterthought** - FERPA and privacy requirements are mandatory
- **University-specific features are essential** - current feature set is insufficient
- **Professional development team required** - this is not a simple fix

**Final Recommendation:** Invest in proper development to create a secure, compliant, and feature-complete solution rather than deploying a vulnerable system.
